# Creating the dev environment
It's recommended to use a python virtual environment to preserve the version of dependencies, here's how you do that:

First, open a terminal in the StrubiumHammer-master folder (the top level!)   
Then, create a new python(3.8+) virtual environment  
(Linux users may need to install python-venv first `$ python -m venv venv`  )  
 
## Activate your new virtual environment   
* Windows: `$ call venv/scripts/activate`  
* Mac / Linux: `$ source venv/bin/activate`
  
Finally, install all dependencies with pip
`$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can now run StrubiumHammer from the terminal  
`$ python hammer.py`
